[EUROSENTIMETN Reviews Cloud And Explore](http://eurosentiment-resources.herokuapp.com) 
=========================================
This is a simple application that uses both lexica and corpora in the EUROSENTIMENT portal to show reviews and their associated keywords.

Although this application does not show the full potential of the portal, it can get you started with building your own service or application.

It is built using Flask and Request, and can be easily deployed to a PaaS such as Heroky.
You can see it working here:
